# Emma: A decentralized marketplace for tokenized products and services

## The Problem

The problem we're trying to solve is twofold:

1. Currently, the only way for producers and manufacturers to be able to sell their products to end customers is through major retail chains, such as supermarkets. These chains take advantage of their privileged position to squeeze profits out of the producers.
2. The retail industry is very capital-intensive, and so there is a huge barrier to entry for new players, especially smaller ones. This in turn causes the market to be owned by very few large players, usually national and global chains.


## To Do

1. Batch addition of products to inventory, by taking advantage of EIP-1155's batch operations.
2. Include the shipment service provider as one of the market participants. Currently it is assumed that payment for the shipping services is made off-chain by the sender of the goods, using traditional payment methods.
3. Make the protocol and warehouse fees adjustable via a function call.
